# Digit-Classifier
This digit classifier is built using the PyTorch deep learning framework and trained on the famous MNIST dataset, which is a collection of handwritten digits that has been widely used as a benchmark for image classification tasks.

The model utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which has been shown to be highly effective for image classification tasks. The model is composed of several layers of convolutional and pooling operations, followed by fully connected layers to produce the final classification output.

Overall, this digit classifier demonstrates the power of PyTorch for deep learning tasks and highlights the effectiveness of CNNs for image classification tasks. The model has the potential to be applied in a wide range of applications, from automatic digit recognition in banking to optical character recognition in document scanning.
